            Privacy is a core value in this App. Our search feature displays
            names against telephone numbers and your profile details are private
            by default. This way, your identity remains private. To ensure
            optimum privacy, we allow restricted attempts of such searches per
            day to avoid misuse of your information. Additionally, we do not
            collect any address book data without user consent. We process any
            personal information only in accordance with our applicable privacy
            policy. Our services are intended for and can only be availed by
            users who confirm their eligibility to avail them upon their review
            of the applicable terms of services and privacy policy.
